# A-Pathfinding
A* Pathfinding algorithm in Python

<hr>

<h2>Write-Up</h2>

This A* pathfinding program was to help learn the basics behind pathfinding by following the algorithm on Wikipedia. I was also trying to learn the tkinter gui package for Python, and updating a grid of rectangles with their colors based on what kind of node they represent seemed like a good way to start.

This is my first attempt at the A* algorithm, but I plan on adding more attempts, maybe with different restrictions, or a different GUI style.
